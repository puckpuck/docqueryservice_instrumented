# Project Goals: Observability Solution Demo

## Purpose
Build a simple application that demonstrates observability features (metrics, logs, traces) across a full-stack setup. The app will be deployed on a hybrid platform and connect to a cloud database.

## Functional Requirements

### Frontend
- Simple UI with basic forms and data display
- Interacts with backend via REST APIs
- Uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript or any frontend framework (React, Angular, etc.)
- **Deployment**: Separate from backend APIs, deployed on Non-Azure cloud machine
- Implements real user monitoring (RUM) instrumentation using OpenTelemetry

### Backends
- **2 backends required**: Non-Azure and Azure
- RESTful APIs with endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Current services**: .NET application and Java inventory service
- **Non-Azure Backend**: Java API service deployed on separate cloud machine from frontend
- **Azure Backend**: .NET API service deployed to Azure App Services
- Both connect to shared cloud database in Azure
- Implements logging, metrics, and tracing instrumentation using OpenTelemetry

### Database
- **Shared cloud database**: Azure SQL or PostgreSQL hosted in Azure
- Used by both Non-Azure and Azure backend services
- Stores simple entities
- No migration of existing local database contents required
- Implements logging, metrics, and tracing instrumentation using OpenTelemetry

### Observability Platform
- **Honeycomb.io** cloud SaaS, external to all of the above
- Receives data from all components and provides a unified view of the system's health and performance
- Uses standard OpenTelemetry protocol
- **OpenTelemetry Collectors**: Setup may differ across environments/machines (configuration to be determined)

## Use Cases to Demonstrate

### 1. Core Observability & Incident Management
**Infrastructure Monitoring**
- Metrics collection for CPU, memory, disk, and network across both on-prem & cloud resources
- Network performance monitoring
- Native integrations with AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Operations Suite
- Configure alert thresholds, health checks, and node/service availability checks

### 2. APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Instrument the hybrid demo app for end-to-end distributed tracing across services
- Show latency breakdown, errors/exceptions, and database/external-call timings
- Include code-level profiling and release markers
- Real-time application profiling and performance benchmarks

### 3. Synthetic Monitoring
- Set up synthetic monitors for different APIs and web pages with custom scripts/assertions
- Test status, headers, payload
- Multi-location tests, uptime/SLA reports, alert routing
- Page-load/Core Web Vitals tests

### 4. Digital Experience Monitoring
- Instrument demo app for RUM
- Capture user sessions, page views, errors, JS exceptions, Core Web Vitals
- Geo/device breakdowns
- Synthetic monitors and baselining/seasonality for comparisons

### 5. Business Intelligence
- Dashboard correlating technical performance (latency, error rate, throughput) with business KPIs
- Transaction volume, conversion, revenue metrics
- Cohort filters and drill-downs
- Create SLI from existing telemetry; define SLO and error budget
- Show burn-rate alerts; overlay business events (release, feature flags)
- Customer segments; dependency-aware alerting

### 6. Telemetry Pipelines
- Configure OpenTelemetry/agent pipeline with sampling, enrichment, PII redaction
- Routing to multiple backends
- Hot-reload (without full restart of agents) and back-pressure handling
- Custom metrics instrumentation

### 7. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) _(not required for this implementation)_
- Correlate SIEM detections with telemetry data
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Threat intel enrichment
- SOAR playbook execution
- UEBA and anomaly detection with tuning

### 8. AI/ML, Automation and Remediation
**Automated RCA (Root Cause Analysis)**
- Simulate an outage (e.g., increased latency in downstream DB or API)
- Walk through RCA workflow using correlated metrics, logs, traces, events
- Change/release markers to reduce MTTD and MTTR

### 9. AI/ML Insight (Predictive Anomaly Detection)
- Simulate an issue and show anomaly detection on metrics/traces/logs
- Baseline models, predictions, alert deduplication/noise reduction
- Incident correlation, automated workflows, and remediation templates

### 10. Automation & Remediation
- Automated alert enrichment with related metrics/logs/traces
- Runbook links, CMDB/service context, and recent changes
- Trigger automated remediation (scale out, restart service) with approvals and rollback
- Show automatic remediation capabilities

### 11. End-to-End LLM Application Observability
- Instrument LLM-backed workflow
- Show prompt/response traces, prompt variables, model/endpoint selection
- Latency, token counts/costs, error categorization (timeouts/refusals)
- Eval scores and safety guardrails

### 12. GenAI Capabilities
- On-call engineer natural-language questions on recent incidents/logs/metrics
- Get RCA hypotheses, summaries, and automated runbook actions
- Include guardrails and data governance options

### 13. Integration & Ecosystem Compatibility
**Shift Left of Monitoring & Integrating with CI/CD Pipeline**
- Demonstrate integration with CI/CD pipeline (Azure DevOps, AWS Code pipeline)
- Measure and monitor performance deviations from code changes or application promotions

### 14. Integrate with ITSM (ServiceNow)
**Service/Topology Mapping and CMDB**
- Bidirectional integration with ServiceNow
- Auto-create and update incidents from alerts with deduplication
- Resolve against CMDB CIs and service maps
- Update CI relationships from application discovery
- Sync change records and maintenance windows

## Current Architecture
The existing Document Query Service project provides:
- Nothing yet

However, the aim is to implement APIs for searching a document store, and retrieving documents. The API should be modeled on that provided by the World Bank's Document & Report API, as documented at https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/api

The same API will be implemented in _both_ .NET and Java, with the frontend UI giving the option to choose between the two. The frontend itself will provide pages for building queries and navigating the results, implemented in React.

There will be a single script which builds all the necessary components and runs them locally as individual services, with options to stop, start, and get status.
